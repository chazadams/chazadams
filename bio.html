<h4>The life and times of a number four</h4> 
  <br>
<p>
  Did you know I was the 4th of my name? Now you do.
  <br>
  Born and raised in Buffalo, NY. Okay that is not entirely true. I started life out in 
  Cheektowaga, NY where we lived until I was 6 before moving to Clarence, NY where my family
  still resides.<br>
  Graduate of Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY. I am a very proud Golden Knight, those four years helped define me
  and I am forever grateful for the bonds that were formed and the opportunities that I had there. I am a lifetime
  member of the fraternity that is WTSC Radio which has proudly broadcast from the Clarkson campus for over 50 years.<br>
  Moved to Worcester, MA in November of 2013. It was actually never my intention to return to Buffalo after college,
  but life happens, situations change and thats where I was. Buffalo will forever be home but sometimes you have to
  put home in the rearview mirror and branch out on new adventures.<br>
</p>
  <h4>My Gear</h4>
  2011 Macbook Pro 13" <br>
  White Pebble Smart Watch <br>
  iPhone 6 - 64gb <br>
  Fitbit Flex <br>
  Nexus 7 <br>
  <br>

    Sometimes I write, read all about it:<br>
