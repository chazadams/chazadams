  <h1>The Future of Chaz is here</h1>

  <p>Hi Kevin!.</p>
  
  <p>Always hungry for more, living life, loving life and never resting on my laurels. 
  I am passionate about the ever changing tech world, automotive design and culture, tattoos, exploring the world and finding a new mountain to tackle by foot and with my snowboard. 
  I bleed pride for my home town of Buffalo and am a proud Clarkson Golden Knight. 
  Formerly the head organizer of TEDxBuffalo.
  Go out and do something with your life.

  Welcome to me</p>
